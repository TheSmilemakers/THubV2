2. **Performance Optimization** (P1-2)
   - Profile glassmorphism effects performance
   - Optimize bundle size and code splitting
   - Implement performance monitoring
   - Add loading states and skeleton loaders

3. **Data Integration** (P1-3)
   - Replace mock data with real API calls
   - Implement WebSocket real-time updates
   - Add caching strategies for EODHD API
   - Error handling for API failures

4. **Mobile Performance** (P1-4)
   - Optimize blur effects for mid-range devices
   - Test performance on actual devices
   - Implement progressive enhancement
   - Add touch gesture improvements

### Week 2 Goals
- **Testing Coverage**: 80%+ unit test coverage
- **Performance**: 60fps on iPhone 12+, 30fps on mid-range Android
- **Real Data**: Replace all mock data with live feeds
- **Mobile UX**: Native app-like experience

## 🔍 Quality Standards Maintained

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, 0 errors, no `any` types
- **Linting**: All files pass lint checks
- **Formatting**: Consistent code style throughout
- **Performance**: 60fps target maintained

### Security Standards
- **Authentication**: Token-based with proper validation
- **Authorization**: RLS policies enforce access control
- **Audit Trail**: All actions logged for monitoring
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas on all endpoints

### Accessibility Standards
- **ARIA Labels**: Descriptive labels on interactive elements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All components keyboard accessible
- **Screen Readers**: Compatible with assistive technologies
- **Color Contrast**: Meets WCAG 2.1 AA requirements

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Considerations

### Current Limitations
1. **Testing**: 0% test coverage (planned for Week 2)
2. **Mock Data**: Still using mock data (P1 priority)
3. **Bundle Size**: Could be optimized further
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Infrastructure exists but needs implementation

### Architecture Decisions
1. **React Query**: Chosen over SWR for better TypeScript support
2. **Error Boundaries**: Class components used for error catching
3. **RLS Policies**: Token-based rather than JWT for MVP simplicity
4. **Glassmorphism**: Performance-aware with device capability detection

### Essential Commands
```bash
# TypeScript check (must pass)
npx pnpm type-check

# Development server
npx pnpm dev

# Build verification
npx pnpm build

# Performance testing

### Architecture Considerations
1. **React Query**: Leverage the new implementation for all data fetching
2. **Error Boundaries**: Use the specialized boundaries for new components
3. **Accessibility**: Maintain the standards established in P0 fixes
4. **Security**: Follow the RLS patterns established
