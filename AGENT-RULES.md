# AGENT-RULES.md - Mandatory Operating Procedures for AI Agents

## üö® CRITICAL: These Rules Are MANDATORY

All AI agents working on THub V2 MUST follow these rules without exception. Violation of these rules indicates substandard work quality.

## üìã Pre-Work Requirements

### Before Starting ANY Task

1. **Read Project Documentation**
   ```bash
   # MANDATORY reading order:
   1. README.md - Project overview
   2. DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md - Architecture patterns
   3. DEVELOPMENT-LOG.md - Current status
   4. AGENT-HANDOVER.md - Immediate tasks
   5. This file (AGENT-RULES.md)
   ```

2. **Verify Build Status**
   ```bash
   npx pnpm type-check  # MUST show 0 errors
   npx pnpm build       # MUST succeed
   ```

3. **Check Performance Baseline**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to /dev/testing and run performance tests
   # Document current FPS baseline before making changes
   ```

## ‚úÖ Validation-First Development

### The Golden Rule
**"No claim without validation, no feature without test, no completion without compilation"**

### üèÜ WEEK 1 SUCCESS PROVEN
This methodology successfully delivered:
- **32/32 UI Components** completed with premium quality
- **0 TypeScript Errors** maintained throughout
- **60fps Performance** validated with real measurements
- **Frontend Progress** jumped from 55% to 85%

**This is now the proven standard for THub V2 development.**

### Mandatory Validation Steps

1. **TypeScript Compilation Gate**
   - Run `npx pnpm type-check` after EVERY change
   - NEVER proceed with TypeScript errors
   - 0 errors is the only acceptable state

2. **Performance Validation**
   - All performance claims MUST have FPS measurements
   - Use `/dev/testing` for manual validation
   - Run `npm run test:performance` for automated tests
   - Document actual measured performance, not theoretical

3. **Mobile Testing Requirements**
   - Test on actual viewport sizes (not just browser resize)
   - Use Chrome DevTools device emulation at minimum
   - Document which devices were tested
   - Never claim "mobile-optimized" without testing

## üîÑ Quality Coding Methodology

### Step-by-Step Implementation

After EVERY change, provide this assessment:

```markdown
## STEP X.X ASSESSMENT: [Action Taken]

**What I Changed:**
- Specific files modified
- Exact changes made

**Validation Performed:**
- ‚úÖ TypeScript check: 0 errors
- ‚úÖ Build successful: Yes/No
- ‚úÖ Performance tested: XX fps measured
- ‚úÖ Mobile tested: Device/viewport used

**Impact Assessment:**
‚úÖ POSITIVE: [Specific improvements]
‚ö†Ô∏è CONCERNS: [Any issues or risks]

**Quality Metrics:**
- Compilation: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (0 errors)
- Performance: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (XX fps)
- Code Quality: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Documentation: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Next Step:** [Clear recommendation]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Development Standards

### Code Quality Standards

1. **TypeScript Strict Mode**
   - NO `any` types ever
   - NO `@ts-ignore` comments
   - Define interfaces for ALL data structures
   - Use proper generics

2. **Error Handling**
   - Try-catch ALL async operations
   - Provide user-friendly error messages
   - Log errors with context
   - Never swallow errors silently

3. **Performance Standards**
   - Desktop: 60fps minimum
   - Mobile high-end: 60fps target
   - Mobile mid-range: 30fps minimum
   - Touch response: <50ms
   - Initial load: <2s on 4G

### Testing Requirements

1. **Before Claiming Feature Complete**
   - Unit tests written (if applicable)
   - Manual testing performed
   - Performance validated
   - TypeScript compilation successful
   - Documentation updated

2. **Performance Testing**
   ```bash
   # Local testing
   npm run test:performance
   
   # CI testing
   npm run test:performance:ci
   
   # Manual testing
   Navigate to /dev/testing
   ```

## üìä Measurement Over Claims

### Unacceptable Claims
‚ùå "Optimized for mobile" (without FPS data)
‚ùå "High performance" (without measurements)
‚ùå "Works perfectly" (without testing)
‚ùå "TypeScript compliant" (with compilation errors)
‚ùå "Ready for production" (without validation)

### Required Evidence
‚úÖ "Mobile: 45fps on iPhone 12 (tested via /dev/testing)"
‚úÖ "Performance: 60fps desktop, 35fps mobile (measured)"
‚úÖ "TypeScript: 0 errors on type-check"
‚úÖ "Tested on: Chrome 120, Safari 17, Firefox 121"
‚úÖ "Load time: 1.8s on simulated 4G"

## üöß CI/CD Gates

### Mandatory Checks Before Merge

1. **TypeScript Compilation**
   ```bash
   npx pnpm type-check  # Must pass with 0 errors
   ```

2. **Build Success**
   ```bash
   npx pnpm build  # Must complete successfully
   ```

3. **Performance Tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test:performance:ci  # Must meet thresholds
   ```

## üìù Documentation Requirements

### When to Update Documentation

1. **DEVELOPMENT-LOG.md**
   - After completing any significant task
   - When encountering/fixing major issues
   - After performance improvements
   - When learning important lessons

2. **AGENT-HANDOVER.md**
   - Before switching to another task
   - When blocked on something
   - After completing assigned work
   - When discovering new requirements

3. **Code Comments**
   - Complex algorithms need explanation
   - Performance optimizations need justification
   - Workarounds need context
   - API contracts need documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Violations to Avoid

### Technical Violations
1. ‚ùå Committing code with TypeScript errors
2. ‚ùå Making performance claims without measurements
3. ‚ùå Using `any` type to bypass TypeScript
4. ‚ùå Ignoring error handling
5. ‚ùå Skipping validation steps

### Process Violations
1. ‚ùå Not running type-check before claiming completion
2. ‚ùå Not testing on mobile viewports
3. ‚ùå Not documenting breaking changes
4. ‚ùå Making multiple changes without assessment
5. ‚ùå Claiming features work without testing

### Documentation Violations
1. ‚ùå Not updating DEVELOPMENT-LOG.md
2. ‚ùå Making false or exaggerated claims
3. ‚ùå Not documenting known issues
4. ‚ùå Leaving outdated information
5. ‚ùå Not providing reproduction steps for bugs

## üéØ Success Criteria

A task is ONLY complete when:

1. ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation: 0 errors
2. ‚úÖ Build process: Successful
3. ‚úÖ Performance: Measured and documented
4. ‚úÖ Mobile: Tested and validated
5. ‚úÖ Documentation: Updated and accurate
6. ‚úÖ Code quality: Follows all standards
7. ‚úÖ Tests: Written and passing (where applicable)

## üîß Tools and Commands

### Essential Commands
```bash
# TypeScript validation (run after EVERY change)
npx pnpm type-check

# Build validation
npx pnpm build

# Performance testing
npm run test:performance

# Development server
npx pnpm dev

# Access testing interface
http://localhost:3000/dev/testing
```

### Performance Validation Tools

- `/src/lib/utils/mobile-testing.ts` - Mobile-specific tests
- `/src/lib/utils/performance-regression.ts` - CI/CD tests
- `/dev/testing` - Manual testing interface

## üö® Escalation Process

If you encounter situations where these rules cannot be followed:

1. Document the specific issue
2. Explain why the rule cannot be followed
3. Propose an alternative approach
4. Get approval before proceeding
5. Document the exception in DEVELOPMENT-LOG.md
